Hi, can you please further explain how this works? 
I started off reading on node.js,
thinking it was all I needed but when I still couldn't get my pages displaying,
I looked up why and came on to info on express.
Now I followed info on the express 4.2 page,
and ran into the error above which you helped with.
Now I got ejs and it still does not seem to be all I need. 
Can you please give me a flow of how this ought to work please?
